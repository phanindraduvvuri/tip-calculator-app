## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Building this project I learned a lot of JavaScript. This project includes a lot of getting values from the DOM elements and manipulating the DOM.

### Continued development

After this project I will continue learning a lot more about DOM manipulation. I will also learn some CSS pre-processor like SCSS.
